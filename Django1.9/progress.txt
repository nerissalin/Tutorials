- working off Django 1.9 instead of 1.8 ._.
- need for different settings.py so we create file and make them inherit from base.py which is original settings.py moved
- different hooks for virtualenvwrapper - preactivate, post activate, predeactivate, postdeactivate
- setting a post activate script that will set Django_settings_module variable just after activating
- pre deactivate will clean it up before deactivating
- accidentally renamed everything django 1.9 but actually running on 1.8.5
- use hooks to hide information like secret_key
- .git ignore files that aren’t necessary, pushed up to github we’re up and running!
