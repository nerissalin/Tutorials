- Set up the work environment for Django Task Busters Tutorial
- Setting up a test for the project - "Tests functionality from user POV"
- Got through part 1, Check out files for Selenium to use to test more thoroughly at a later stage

- pip freeze > requirements.txt 
- make requirements for each environment for editing needed packages
- staging.txt file for semi-private version of site on production server
- working off Django 1.9 instead of 1.8 ._.
- need for different settings.py so we create file and make them inherit from base.py which is original settings.py moved
- different hooks for virtualenvwrapper - preactivate, post activate, predeactivate, postdeactivate
- setting a post activate script that will set Django_settings_module variable just after activating
- pre deactivate will clean it up before deactivating
- accidentally renamed everything django 1.9 but actually running on 1.8.5
- use hooks to hide information like secret_key
- .git ignore files that aren’t necessary, pushed up to github we’re up and running!

- adding static url -> guides django to look for static files in folder named static
- adding Static Files directory in the same way that base dir was found
- slightly modifying templates as well
- using initializer - moving files to the right places

- Starting part 4. Since robot and humans.txt may be parsed by search engines we're taking them available at the urls
- Added the functional tests for it to make sure they exist
- Making an update to urls to add home_views and regex: r'^(?P<filename>(robots.txt)|(humans.txt))$',
home_files, name='home-files')," that takes desired urls and passes as argument the filename.
- Testing with coverage: install, freeze and report
- Checks the lines of code run and not ran
