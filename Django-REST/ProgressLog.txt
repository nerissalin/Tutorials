-Working on Django REST framework
	- http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/
-Added a virtual environment
	-Works only when command called from directory where env exists
	-Useful for keeping dependencies in seperate places 
	-ie. this project needs Django 1.0 but another would need Django 1.3
