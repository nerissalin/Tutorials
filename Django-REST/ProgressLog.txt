-Working on Django REST framework
	- http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/
-Added a virtual environment
	-Works only when command called from directory where env exists
	-Useful for keeping dependencies in seperate places 
	-ie. this project needs Django 1.0 but another would need Django 1.3
-Ran command django-admin.py startproject tutorial
	-makes a structure with a file tutorial and the following:
		-manage.py instead of django-admin.py
		-__init__.py which indicates the folder is a package
		-settings.py settings file created from a template
		-urls.py for URL structure
		-wsgi.py for WSGI script
